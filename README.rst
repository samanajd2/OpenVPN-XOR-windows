Directories
**************************************************
This is the latest stable release of the OpenVPN Windows client compiled with added support for the Tunnelblick obfuscation patch.

More info about the obfuscation patch can be found here: https://tunnelblick.net/cOpenvpn_xorpatch.html


************************************************


NOTE: Xor patch works fine with [TAP-windows](https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows6) and [wintun](https://github.com/WireGuard/wintun). But until now, It cannot work with ([DCO driver](https://github.com/OpenVPN/ovpn-dco-win)). You can find more details here https://github.com/OpenVPN/



Thats all ....
